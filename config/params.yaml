# Rates
delta: 0.025     # Time delta that determines the size of used points for localizing
rate: 40       # Should be at least 1/delta (> 1/delta may use previously used points to localize)

# Delays
empty_lidar_time: 10      # Should be at least [FULL_ROTATION_TIME]
real_time_delay: 0.5      # Should be at least [FULL_ROTATION_TIME] (without a modificated LiDAR driver)

# LiDAR
full_rotation_time: 0.1
